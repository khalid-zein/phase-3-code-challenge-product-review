## Introduction

For this assignment, you will be working with a Magazine domain.

 

We have three models: Author, Article, and Magazine.

 

For our purposes, an Author has many Articles, a Magazine has many Articles, and Articles belong to both Author and Magazine.

 

Author - Magazine is a many to many relationship.

 

Note: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard before you start coding. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.
