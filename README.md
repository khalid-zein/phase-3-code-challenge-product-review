# phase-3-code-challenge-product-review

## Introduction

For this assignment, we'll be working with an e-commerce domain. We'll be focusing on the product reviews.

 

We have three models: User, Review, and Product.

 

For our purposes, a Product has many Users, a User has many Productsâ€™ s, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.

 

Product - User is a many-to-many relationship.

 

Note: You should design your domain/Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) using any Unified Modelling Language such as starUML Links to an external site.before you start coding. You are required to include it in your README.
